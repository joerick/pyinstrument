# Integration Testing Report for Pyinstrument
## Test integration profiler
### Test Design Summary
This integration test covered the interaction between the Profiler core module, responsible for managing profiling lifecyce and collecting call stack samples and the output renderer module which formats and produces human readable profiling reports. The test verified the profiling of a synchronous workload function and confirmed accurate data capture and output generation.

### Test Data Preparation
The test daata consisted of a simple synchronous python function defined inside the test which computes the sum of numbers from 0 to 999. The profiling output text generated by the renderer was collected and analyzed for correctness.

### Execution and Results
The test was run using pytest. The profiler was started before executing the workload and stopped thereafter. Assertions validated that:

- The workload function returned the correct result
- The profiler output contained expected markers indicating profiling activity
- Internal profiler details were not leaked in outputs

The test succeeded without defects confirming correct integration of the profiler core and output renderer modules for synchronous profiling scenarios.
